  <h2>Our Story</h2>


From Small Beginnings to Big Builds

Back in 1992, Tekton Construction started as a small crew with a big dream: to deliver quality projects and treat every client like a partner. Our first jobs were simple home renovations and small business build-outs, but word spread quickly about our attention to detail and reliability.

Over the years, we’ve grown into a trusted name in commercial, residential, and industrial construction. We’ve built offices, schools, retail spaces, and custom homes—always keeping the same promise we made from the start: get the job done right, on time, and with no shortcuts.

Our growth hasn’t changed our values. We still believe that good business is built on trust, clear communication, and craftsmanship that lasts.
