## **Our Story**

**From Small Beginnings to Big Builds**

Back in 1992, **Tekton Construction** started as a small crew with a big dream: to deliver quality projects and treat every client like a partner. Our first jobs were simple home renovations and small business build-outs, but word spread quickly about our attention to detail and reliability.

Over the years, we’ve grown into a trusted name in commercial, residential, and industrial construction. We’ve built offices, schools, retail spaces, and custom homes—always keeping the same promise we made from the start: get the job done right, on time, and with no shortcuts.

Our growth hasn’t changed our values. We still believe that good business is built on trust, clear communication, and craftsmanship that lasts.

If you want, I can also add a **short tagline and mission statement** for Tekton Construction so it works perfectly on your homepage and “About Us” page together. That way, it’ll feel even more complete.

Alicia is responsible for the financial health of the company, including budgeting, forecasting, and investor relations. Her strategic insights have helped drive efficient scaling and cost-effective practices.
