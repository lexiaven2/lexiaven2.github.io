About Us: Our History
Building a Legacy Since 1992

Founded in 1992, SummitEdge Construction began as a small general contracting firm with a bold vision: to raise the standard for quality and integrity in the construction industry. From our humble beginnings working on residential remodels, we quickly earned a reputation for delivering projects on time, on budget, and above expectations.

Over the decades, SummitEdge has grown into a full-service construction company serving commercial, industrial, and residential clients across the region. Our portfolio includes everything from custom homes and retail centers to public infrastructure and high-rise developments.

Through changing markets and evolving client needs, one thing has remained constant—our commitment to excellence. Our success is built on long-standing client relationships, a skilled workforce, and a passion for building projects that stand the test of time.
